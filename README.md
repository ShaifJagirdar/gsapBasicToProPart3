#SVG Slick Animation Project
This project demonstrates interactive SVG path animations using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). The animation reacts to mouse movements, creating a fluid and dynamic experience as users interact with the SVG element.

#Features
Interactive SVG Path Animation: The SVG path dynamically adjusts based on mouse position.
Smooth Transition Effects: Elastic and easing effects for a polished and responsive user experience.
Mouse Events: Reacts to mousemove and mouseleave for interactivity.
Responsive Design: Compatible with various screen sizes and devices.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure for the SVG and animation container.
CSS: Styling for the background and SVG layout.
JavaScript: GSAP for SVG path morphing and smooth animations.
GSAP CDN: Lightweight and fast animation library included via CDN.
Getting Started
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ShaifJagirdar/gsapBasicToProPart3.git
Open the index.html file in a browser to view the interactive SVG animation.
Prerequisites
A modern browser that supports SVG and JavaScript.
No additional dependencies; GSAP is included via CDN.
File Structure
index.html: Contains the SVG and animation logic.
Inline CSS: Basic styles for layout and appearance.
Inline JavaScript: Mouse event handlers and GSAP animations.
How to Use
#Explore the Animation:

Move the mouse over the SVG to see the path morph.
Move the mouse away to reset the animation with an elastic effect.
Customize the Animation:

Modify the SVG path or dimensions in the index.html file.
Experiment with GSAP properties like duration, ease, and attr for unique effects.
Add additional event listeners for more interactivity.
Examples
Mouse Interaction: The SVG path dynamically changes shape based on the cursor position.
Reset Animation: When the mouse leaves the SVG area, the path smoothly returns to its original shape with an elastic effect.
